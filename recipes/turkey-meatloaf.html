    <p>
      For a healthier turkey meatloaf, after much trial and error I came up with
      this recipe. It's important to make this on a jelly-roll pan (rimmed
      baking sheet) so the liquids can be drained off. Also, don't put the
      topping on before the meatloaf has cooked for 30 minutes; ground turkey
      creates a lot of juices, so if you put the topping on first it will become
      watery and runny.
